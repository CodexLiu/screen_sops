   b.  Specify the bench scale accuracy needed for any specific substrate being
       weighed (e.g. if precision scale is needed vs bench scale).

5. Reagents and preparation
If applicable, provide step-by-step instructions for preparing solutions to ensure
consistency and accuracy.

      a.  List each reagent  needed   for the  assay  or  experiment  with   clear
          preparation steps.
      b.  Specify quantities, concentrations, and equipment (e.g. Weigh 13 mg L-
          Leucine using an analytical balance).
      c.  Include handling and mixing instructions (e.g. Vortex for 30 seconds).
      d.  Note storage conditions and shelf life (e.g. Store at -20°C for 6 months).
          Add that discard after 3 months or a similar note if not a stable reagent.
      e.  Highlight safety precautions (e.g. Handle TNBS in a fume hood).

6. Sample preparation
Explain how to prepare samples or substrate to ensure they are suitable for the
assay/experiment.
      a.  Describe sample type (e.g. Protein hydrolysates from soy fermentation).
      b.  Include steps for thawing, mixing, or centrifugation (e.g. Centrifuge at
          5,000 rpm for 5 min).
      c.  Specify dilutions if needed (e.g. Dilute 1:10 with ultrapure water).
      d.  Note storage conditions for unused samples.
      e.  Address potential interferences (e.g. decant the supernatant for use and
          discard the pellet or remove particulates to avoid absorbance errors).

7. Procedure
Provide a         step-by-step guide to performing the assay/experiment, ensuring
       reproducibility.
              a.  Break into numbered steps with clear, actionable instructions (e.g. Pipette
                  50 μL sample into wells).
              b.  Specify equipment settings (e.g. Incubate at 50°C for 1 hour).
              c.  Include timing and order of operations (e.g. Add TNBS last to start
                  reaction).
              d.  Note replicates or controls (e.g. Run standards in triplicate).
              e.  Use subheadings for complex protocols (e.g. Standard Curve Preparation,
                  Assay Steps).

8. Data analysis
Explain step by step how to process data and interpret results to derive meaningful
conclusions.
       a.  Describe calculations (e.g. Subtract blank absorbance from all readings).
       b.  Include formulas with definitions (e.g., DH% = 100 × (Lt / Lmax)).
       c.  Specify software/tools (e.g. Use Excel for linear regression).

          enzyme).
      b.  Provide solutions (e.g. Prepare fresh buffer).
      c.  Cover equipment, reagents, and user errors.
      d.  Document the deviations for future users.

10.2 Maintenance instructions
      This section outlines routine tasks to ensure equipment and reagents remain
      in optimal condition.
